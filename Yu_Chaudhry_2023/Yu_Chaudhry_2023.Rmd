# Abstract / Key Points

The core idea of this study is that people in collectivistic cultures expect more from their close others, and therefore they don't feel/express gratitude to them. This is because they believe that their close others are obligated to help them.

This is very simiar to *Zhang et al (2018).* They claimed that their study contibuted to the understanding of where the beliefs about graitude comes from, which is people's expectations about the obligation of the benefactor. 

This study not only shows that the expression of graitutde differed across cultures, but the *feelings* of gratitude also differed.
