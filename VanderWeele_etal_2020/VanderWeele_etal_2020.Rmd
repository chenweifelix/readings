# Abstract / Key Points

A response to Ryff et al. (2020a)'s repose to their recommendations

Single-item measure is still valuable even though it can't capture all the facets of well-being, because what we measure shapes what we discuss, what we know, what we aim for, and policits put in place to achieve it. (make the construct more visible)

Single-item measure is also important because: 

- it strongly correlates with other much richer well-being indices 
- it is highly predictive of future outcomes, including health-related ones
