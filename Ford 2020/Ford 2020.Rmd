Politics and identity ---> "Politics become a marker of who they are and what they stand for" 

  - Politics is often also a source of negative emotions (a chroinic stresor, i.e., a hard-to-change system), which although feels unpleasant, motivates people to engage in political action 
    - `r colored("as they reduce negative emotional responses to politics and protect well-being, they can also reduce the underlying force that motivates people to take political action aimed at changing the political system that evoked the emotions in the first place.", "gold")`
  - the conflict between the personal (hedonic) ER motive and groups's motive to change the system
  
# Thoughts 

The importance of individual political action? 

  - "Political action occurs when individuals engage in any action to achieve group goals in a political context"
  - `r colored("How much would this micro-level momentum translate to the macro-level change?", "gold")` 
  
# Other things 

Emotions other than anger are also motivated, such as sadness and fear

System justification is viewed as *a form* of reappraisal 

This article focuses more on reappraisal, while another commonly used strategy to cope with politics is *distraction*
