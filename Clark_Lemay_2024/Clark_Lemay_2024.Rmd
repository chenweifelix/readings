# Abstract / Key Points

Emotion expression has five functions and these functions often match the cooperation called for in cummunal relationships. 

The impact of emotion expression on listening and on responsiveness depends upon the match (or mismatch) between the cooperative functions a relationship serves and the social functions that expressing emotion can serve

- Expressed emotions convey a speaker’s vulnerabilities, needs and desires and can elicit support
  - e.g., happiness --> all is well to the self 
    - the speaker can (a) contintue what is happening, or (b) help enhance happiness thought social sharing of and enthusiams about the speaker's good furtune
- Speakers’ expressed emotions often convey a speaker’s trust in the listener and can invite responsiveness
- Expressing certain emotions convey important information, not about individuals per se, but about speakers’ relational goals
- Speakers’ emotion expressions can serve a social referencing function
- Listeners’ expressions of relational emotions, as they listen and soon afterwards, can enhance listening
