# Abstract / Key Points

The perceiver makes inferences that the target has paternalistic motives, which contributes to perceivers' feelings of insult 

  - paternalisitc: the intention tp help the target based on assumptions about the target's best interest 

There's clear and robust relational costs of hiding success, but less so on emotional and impression costs 

  - relational: feeling of insult, clseness, and trust (i.e., mutual vulnerability)
  - emotional: envy, happiness 
  - impression: warmth and competence 

Online sample and real-life sample (recruited at a park, a conference, etc.)
