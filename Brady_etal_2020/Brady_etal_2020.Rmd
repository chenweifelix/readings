# Abstract / Key Points

Motivation-Attention-Design to explain moral contagion online 

Why is it important? 
- Polarization 
- Amplification of the tendency to express moral emotions 
- Core to online social movement mobilization and campaigns
- Precipitate political action such as protests and violence

# Motivation based on group identity (partisanship)
- Theoretical frameworks: social identity theory, self-categorization theory, and intergroup emotion theory 
- Key intergroup motivation: Positive distinctiveness between the ingroup and relevant outgroups
  - When identity is under thread (either from outgroup or ingroup), the motivation becomes stronger
  - Responses to outgroup threat: 
    - Negative emotion: outrage, contempt
    - Positive emotion: gratitude, elevation 
    - Self-emotion: guilt, shame <-- threat within the ingroup
- Key intragroup motivation: Maintain a positive image within the ingroup (to be a valuable member) 
  - To increase reputation and belongingness 

## Design and identity motivation  
- Larger, less personally connected network makes group identification more salient
- Deindividuation as a result of interacting via a machine 
- Immediate social feedback that is unambiguous, ubiquitous, and quantifiable

# Attention 
- Moral and emotional content has an attentional advantage (e.g., noticed early)
- What counts as moral depends on group norms and values 
- Habituation is likely to occur when people are repeatedly exposed to moralized content 

## Design and attention 
- Algorithms are external attentional filter --> preselecting moral and emotional content that our perceptual system has a tendency to notice in the first place 
- Notifications --> draw attention back in 

# Design 
- Content is relatively static --> people may be more likely to post things that are "universal" (not changed with time) and "objective"
- High-fidelity information transmission --> content is not distorted as it spreads; people less connected to the poster can understand the event 
- Multimodal representation with image or video 
- Rapid response options 
- Reduced personal costs that make interpersonal policing more common 
  - Costs such as retaliation possibility, or empathic distress 
- Consider the case where platform itself has an explicit goal of regulating users' emotions
