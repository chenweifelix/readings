# Abstract / Key Points

Basically a shorter version of Gross 2015 

Definition of mental health (WHO): 

"mental health is a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community"

All affective states share a common dimension: valuation (i.e., good-for-me vs. bad-for-me). The function of affective states is to shape behavior in accordance with the relationship between situation and motivational concerns.

affective states, including the following (in hierarchical order [continuum] based on how many affect generation stages are generally part of the conscious experience of the given affective state, p.131) 

  - emotions: all four stages are generally part of the experience 
  - stress: appraisal + response; experiences revolve around broader circumstances (e.g., new job, divorce) that span several specific situations 
  - impulses: response and situation
  - mood: diffuse feelings and action tendencies; tends to relate to situations that have been selectively perceived and appraised largely outside of awareness 

`r colored("the model also suggests that unhealthy affect can be traced back to maladaptive unfolding of one or more of the four affect genera- tion stages.", "gold", bold = T)`
