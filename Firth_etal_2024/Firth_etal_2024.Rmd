  - Cognitive mechanisms 
    - Deficits in inhibitory control 
    - Attentional bias 
- Pointless distraction vs. positive stimulation 
  - there's a lack of causal evidence for improving attention through withdrawal 
  - ABCD study: no consistent evidence for causal relations between digital screen media usage and functional connectivity in children 
    - Some screen media activities were found to be linked to poorer cognitive outcomes, while others were associated with better performance   
- The offline effects of an online world: implications for body and brain 
  - displacement hypothesis 
- Revisiting social outcomes of online lives 
  - Internet users seems to recognize the challenge of resisting the pressure to "care too much" about social media validation
