# Abstract / Key Points

`r colored("I think this framework is helpful in thinking about (1) when people are reluctant to reappraise, what prevents them? (what tpyes/levels of representation?; what operation was not at play?) (2) when people failed to reppraise, what went wrong?", "gold", bold = T)`

  - pain points at frequency and/or efficacy

Type of targeted representation: 

  - reconstrual: changes in perceptions/ subjective meaning of the the current state 
  - repurposing: changes in the desired states 
  

Type of operation: 

  - commitment: engage in alternative representations (without necessarily undermining the current representation)
  - decommitment: disengage from the currently dominant representations (without necessarily having an alternative representation)

  - Question about their dinstinction of meta-level and objective-level representation; raise a good point about their figure 2 about "Is feeling this way really that bad" as a meta-level construal vs. "It's fine to not be happy all the time" as a meta-level repurposing
