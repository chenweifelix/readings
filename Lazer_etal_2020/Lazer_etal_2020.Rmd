# Abstract / Key Points

We define CSS as the development and application of computational methods to complex, typically large-scale, human (sometimes simulated) *behavioral* data (1). Its intellectual antecedents include research on spatial data, social networks, and human coding of text and images. 

Computational researchers and social scientists tend to be in different units in distinct corners of the university, and there are few mechanisms to bring them together.

To justify such an outsized investment, computational social scientists must make the case that *the result will be more than the publication of journal articles of interest primarily to other researchers*. They must articulate how the combination of academic, industrial, and governmental collaboration and dedicated scientific infrastructure will solve important problems for society—saving lives; improving national security; enhancing economic prosperity; nurturing inclusion, diversity, equity, and access; bolstering democracy; etc.
