# Abstract / Key Points

- Use the language from twitter (S1) and speeches from the congress (S2) to analyze the difference in moral foundations. 
- Theory suggests that liberals endorse individualizing foundations (harm and fairness) more than conservatives, and conservatives endorse binding foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity) more than liberals 
- Reasons to suspect that less power might lead to changes in moral language use: 
  - Social identity theory: less power --> threatened --> elevating in-group values to sacred principles and casting out-group members as irredeemably wicked 
  - Strategic considerations: moralization is effective in persuading others and mobilizing support
- Method: 
  - Word embedding (like the one used by Tessa)
- Result: 
  - `r colored("Overall, lower political power was associted with greater use of moral language for both Democrats and Republicans")`
