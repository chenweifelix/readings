# Abstract 

def: Placebo and nocebo effects are salubrious benefits and negative outcomes attributable to non-specific symbolic components.

We review advances in employing psychosocial, pharmacological, and neuromodulation approaches to modulate/harness placebo and nocebo effects.

# Introduction 

`r side_note("Schedlowski M, Enck P, Rief W, Bingel U. Neuro-bio-behavioral mechanisms of placebo and nocebo responses: implications for clinical trials and clinical practice. Pharm Rev. 2015;67:697–730.")`
Placebo and nocebo effects have been observed in a plethora of conditions including pain, Parkinson’s disease, *depression*, anxiety disorders, immunologic responses, cardiovascular functions, and sleep disorders. 

The improved understanding of placebo and nocebo effects has built a basis for the crucial next step: shifting from understanding their biopsychosocial mechanisms through systematic observation to *modulating placebo and nocebo effects through experimental paradigms/designs or brain stimulation methods*. The proposed research focus shift echoes the growing interest in *optimizing placebo effects to improve therapeutic outcomes* and minimizing nocebo effects to avoid unintended exacerbation of symptoms in medical practice.

# Behavioral and neural bases for harnessing placebo and nocebo effects 

## Behavioral bases of placebo and nocebo effects 

`r colored("Expectiontion", "gold")` and `r colored("Leanring", "gold")`

Expectations 

  (1) verbal information 
  (2) associative learning, especially classic conditioning 
  (3) observational conditioning  
  (4) operant conditioning (reward/punishment)

Desire for pain relief interacted with expectations

Reduction of negaitve emotions as the mediator 

## Neural responses underlying placebo and nocebo effects 

Placebo analgesia can be bloced by naloxone <--- endogenous opioid and descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) play a crucial role 

Key regions in the DPMS originate in the cingulate cortex and PFC ---> PAG ---> rostroventral medulla and spinal cord 

Meta-analysis showed that placebo analgesia only has small effects on the neurologic pain signature ---> likely to act at the level of several brain netowrks beyond nociception that may be important for the emotions, decision making, and behaviors surrounding pain 

# Harnessing placebo and nocebo effects using psychosocial, pharmacological, and neuromodulation approaches

## Psychosocial approaches 

  1. Expectations
  2. Learning 
  3. Social interactions 

Combination of verbal suggestions/instructions and conditioning 

  - order matters ---> in placebo, verbal first; in nocebo, order doesn't matter 

Nocebo hyperalgesia is hard to get rid of when it is established via classical conditioning 

Social interaction (e.g., doctor-patient relationships)

  - exactly how this can be manipulated or applied is still under debate 

<img src="IMG_E6526734384D-1.jpeg" class="center">
Psychosocial approaches, including valuable information and enhanced conditioning (i.e., verbal suggestion precedes conditioning), modulate the reward system (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex [vmPFC], nucleus accumbens [NAc], and ventral tegmental area [VTA]). Trustful doctor–patient relationships rely on the brain-to-brain coupling in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), insula, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC).

## Pharmacological approaches 

Oxytocin and vasopressin ---> effects on pain are mixed 

  - previous research was done via verbal instructions 

<img src="IMG_E6526734384D-1 copy.jpeg" class="center">
Intranasally administered oxytocin/vasopressin travels to the brain via olfactory and trigeminal nerve fibers and may modulate placebo-related brain activities in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), NAc, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and brainstem

## Neuromodulation apporaches 

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)

  - TMS
  - Transcranial electrical stimulation 
  <br>
  - PFC (DLPFC, vlPFC, vmPFC)
  <br>
  - limted to cortical regions 

<img src="IMG_E6526734384D-1 copy 2.jpeg" class="center">
Neuromodulational approaches including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electrical stimulation (tES) target key regions in the prefrontal cortex (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC] and orbitofrontal cortex [OFC]) to modulate the reward system and descending pain modulation system (e.g., periaqueductal gray [PAG] and rostral ventromedial medulla [RVM]) to harness placebo effects

# Translating basic research findings into clinical treatment settings 

## General prinicples in clinical practice 

  (a) point out directly that a drug or treatment is effective 
  (b) Demystifying
  (c) build a supportive relationship 
  
## Appluying the learning model in clinical treatment 

condition-lik manipulation ---> expectancy manipulation 

## Varibility of placebo effects 

Sex and race: White, Female show stronger effect 

Psychological factors: expectation, trait optimmism, desire for control, eomtional distress, and maladpative cognitive appraisals of pain
