# Abstract / Key Points

Based on McAdams' (1995) theorizing of personality: self-rated traits ---> personal concerns ---> life story 

  - Personal concerns: motivations, goals, values, and concerns that may come to mind when we get to know someone a little more than what we may know about acquaintances 
  - Life story: life's chapters, turning points, and overall tone ---> weave in traits and personal concerns throughout 

Function words: difficult to detect and to manipulate ---> thinking styles ---> frontal lobes (higher-level thinking and social skills)

Content words: thinking topics ---> temporal lobes (making sense of sensory input, association with emotions, and declaritive memory)

Mentions that LIWC could detect social class, though in the context of leaders (p. 344, and p. 346)

Againg: older adults think less about themsevles, and they become more positive, more future-oriented (why??), and more complex 

Less work on spoken language
